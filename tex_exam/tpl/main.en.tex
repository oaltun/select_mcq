    \textbf{Notes to exam supervisors}: 
        * Exam duration is 110 minutes. * Do not allow students out first 30 minutes, and accept new students only first 30 minutes. * Check each student to see they filled answer sheet name, student id, and key correctly. * Students can use calculators. They can have a scrap paper to write on. Gather the scrap papers at the end of the exam. * Separate student papers into keys at the end of the exam. Gather scrap papers separately, do not interleave to student papers.
        
    \textbf{Notes to students}: 
        * Please enter your name and student ID in the provided spaces and indicate your student ID by filling in the corresponding bubbles. * Enter your answers to the answer sheet. The exam will be graded optically. * Make sure you fill the correct "Key" bubble. * If you think a question may be wrong, tell to the exam supervisors. They will inform me. 
        
        * Standard Normal Distribution Cumulative Distribution Values: 
    
        $\Phi(-1)\approx 0.16$, $\Phi(1)\approx 0.84$, $\Phi(2.24)\approx 0.98$,  $\Phi(2.18)=0.9854$, $\Phi(2.29)=0.9890$

        * Standard Normal Distribution Quantiles:
    
        \(z_{0.10} = \Phi^{-1}(0.90) = 1.282\), \(z_{0.05} = 1.645\), \(z_{0.025} = 1.960\), \(z_{0.01} = 2.326\), \(z_{0.005} = 2.576\).
