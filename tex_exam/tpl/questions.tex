\question A company offers a referral bonus program. For each referred employee who stays at least 6 months, the referrer gets 500 dollars. If the probability that a referred employee stays for 6 months is 0.4, what is the expected bonus for referring one employee in dollars?

\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice 200
\choice 500
\choice 100
\choice 0
\end{oneparchoices}

\begin{solution}
The expected bonus is \(E(X) = 0.4 \times 500 = 200\) dollars.
\end{solution}
    




\question A basketball player has a 70 percent chance of making each free throw. If she takes 10 free throws, what is the expected number of free throws she will make?

\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice $7$ free throws
\choice $3$ free throws
\choice $10$ free throws
\choice $5$ free throws
\end{oneparchoices}

\begin{solution}
The expected number is \(E(X) = np = 10 \times 0.7 = 7\) free throws.
\end{solution}
    




\question A taxi company charges a flat rate of 3 dollars plus 2 dollars per mile. If the distance of a ride follows a uniform distribution between 1 and 5 miles, what is the expected cost of a ride in dollars?

\begin{oneparchoices}
\correctchoice 9
\choice 8
\choice 10
\choice 7
\end{oneparchoices}

\begin{solution}
The expected distance is the mean of the uniform distribution, \(\frac{1 + 5}{2} = 3\) miles. Thus, the expected cost is \(3 + 2 \times 3 = 9\) dollars.
\end{solution}
